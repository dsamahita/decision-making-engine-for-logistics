REAL-WORLD EXECUTION OF MODULE 1 (Sorting Engine)
 Step 1: Orders Come Into the System

In reality, delivery requests don’t come as arrays—they come from:

Mobile apps
Websites
Call centers

Each order is stored in a database like:

Order ID | Weight | Deadline | Priority | Location

 Example:

Order 101 → deadline: 2 hrs, priority: VIP
Order 102 → deadline: 6 hrs, priority: normal
 Step 2: System Pulls Orders (Batch Processing)

Every few minutes (say every 5–10 minutes):

 System does:

“Fetch all pending orders”

Now they are loaded into memory → like your vector<Delivery>

 Step 3: Deadline Sorting (Merge Sort in action)

 Real logic:

Orders with closest deadlines go first
Ensures:
No late deliveries
SLA (service level agreement) is maintained

 Real example:

Food delivery apps → urgent orders first
Medicine delivery → highest urgency
 Step 4: Priority Sorting (Quick Sort logic)
Now among similar deadlines:

 System reorders based on:

VIP customers
Premium users
High-value deliveries

Real-world:

Amazon Prime > normal delivery
Business clients > regular users
Step 5: Real-Time Incoming Orders (Heap)

While sorting is happening…

 New orders keep coming

Instead of re-sorting everything:

System uses a priority queue (heap)

 So:

Highest priority order is always on top
Can instantly assign to a driver

 Real-world:

Swiggy/Zomato assigning riders dynamically
Courier apps adjusting delivery queue live
 COMPLETE FLOW (HOW COMPANIES ACTUALLY DO IT)

 Cycle repeats continuously:

Collect orders
Sort by deadline (Merge Sort logic)
Rank by priority (Quick Sort logic)
Handle live orders (Heap)
Send sorted list → routing system (Module 2)
 SIMPLE REAL-LIFE EXAMPLE

Imagine 5 orders:

ID	Deadline	Priority
A	2 hrs	Low
B	1 hr	High
C	3 hrs	VIP
Step 1: Merge Sort (deadline)

 B → A → C

Step 2: Quick Sort (priority adjustment)

 B (high) → C (VIP) → A

Step 3: Heap (new order arrives)

 D (urgent VIP) jumps to top instantly

🧠 WHAT YOU SAY IN VIVA (IMPORTANT)

“In real-world execution, the sorting module operates in cycles. Orders are fetched periodically and sorted by deadlines using stable sorting. Then priority-based ranking is applied. For dynamic incoming orders, a heap-based priority queue is used to ensure real-time responsiveness. This ensures both fairness and efficiency in delivery scheduling.”
